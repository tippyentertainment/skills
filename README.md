# Skills

This repository is a growing list of our skills — current, evolving, and future. 🚀

**What to expect:** new skill pages, projects, examples, and curated resources will be added over time. Contributions are welcome — add skills, examples, or links via pull requests.

**Files required per skill**

Each skill folder should include a `SKILL.md` containing YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`. Optionally add a `README.md` and example files (scenes, scripts, assets) using the engine-appropriate formats shown in each skill's `Files & Formats` section.
